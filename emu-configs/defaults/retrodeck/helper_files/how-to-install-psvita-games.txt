Please note that the PSVita support is still experimental, and for the way Vita3K is working the automation is limited.
In order to install a PSVita games is needed to:

- Install a game opening the Vita3K emulator via Configurator, the supported formats are pkg, zip, vpk.
- Upon installation the zRIF may be asked, it's different for each game, you can find it via web search.
- Install DLCs and patches in the same way.
- Create an empty file in roms/psvita/gamename.psvita, please mind the .psvita extension. For example: roms/psvita/WipEout 2048 (EU).psvita.
- Edit the empty file adding the game Title ID (more below).
- The game should appear in the game list after RetroDECK is re-opened.

How to find a title ID
It can be found inside the Vita3K GUI in the Title ID column, or found via web search.
For example the game WipEout 2048 (EU) has an ID that is PCSF00007.
So simply add PCSF00007 to the WipEout 2048 (EU).psvita file and the setup for this game is complete.
