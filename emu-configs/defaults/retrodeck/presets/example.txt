config_file_format^retroarch # This is the config file format, used in functions like get_setting_value and set_setting_value
target_file^$examplefile # This is the target file that should be updated. This will be the actively-used config file by whatever emulator is being set up. This can be a variable name as well!
defaults_file^$emuconfigs/retroarch/retroarch.cfg # This is the file that is referenced when presets are disabled. This should be the "shipped" config file for this emulator
change^cheevos^Enabled^true^Cheevos # This is a preset configuration line. The syntax is <action>^<preset name (as defined in retrodeck.cfg)>^<setting name>^<setting value when enabled>^<setting section in emulator config file, if there is one>
change^borders^overlay_file^/var/config/retroarch/overlays/borders/snes.cfg # This is another preset configuration line, for the preset section called "borders" in retrodeck.cfg. Also, there is no defined "setting section" on this line


OTHER NOTES:
- The name of the presets configuration file for any given system MUST be <system name>_presets.cfg
- The <system name> is whatever name is given to this system in retrodeck.cfg, it is not tied to the actual emulator name.
- The name given to the system in retrodeck.cfg will be translated to a "nice looking" format for user dialogs through the file at emu-configs/defaults/retrodeck/reference_lists/pretty_system_names.cfg but will be used internally as-is
