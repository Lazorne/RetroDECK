Welcome to the **RetroDECK wiki**!

### üèóÔ∏è This wiki is currently under construction üèóÔ∏è

# What is RetroDECK?
RetroDECK is a [EmulationStation Desktop Edition](https://es-de.org) powered application that builds in a variety of emulators and other software that allows you to play your favorite retro (and even not-so-retro) games in a tidy contained flatpak sandbox environment. It's inspired by embedded emulation systems like AmberELEC, EmuELEC, CoreELEC, Lakka, and Batocera.

You can also check out our: [Flathub Page](https://flathub.org/apps/net.retrodeck.retrodeck)<br/>

## What devices/systems does RetroDECK support: 

### Steam Deck

Supported from the start and RetroDECK is tailored to the Steam Deck during the beta period. The goal is that all the configurations are ready out-of-the-box and optimized towards the Steam Deck.

### Linux Desktop
Technically it is working, but the user experience might not be that great it could contain desktop specific bugs and other issues.
You will also need to manually configure the input to match your desktop and might need to tweak more settings. If you want to try it make sure that your distribution has flatpak support (else you will need to install it).<br>
We will start to have a bigger desktop focus after the beta period is over.


### Other SteamOS or Linux handheld gaming devices with flatpak support
We do plan to support other SteamOS based devices in the future. But during the BETA we are focusing on the Steam Deck.<br/> 
You can get it to run on other Linux based devices it is not just as seamless as we want it to be and does not live up to our higher standards.<br/> 
You will need to manually configure the input to match your device and might need to tweak more settings if you try it on a none Steam Deck device. There might also be some hardware specific bugs. 

## Do you have any plans for other systems? 
RetroDECK does not have plans to support Windows, macOS, Android, or iOS.<br>For similar functionality on Windows you could explore [Retrobat](https://www.retrobat.org/) as an alternative.


## How do I start using RetroDECK?

Please read the [How to: Getting started](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/How-to:-Getting-started)

## RetroDECK is currently in in BETA and is not a full release.

- What does "currently in beta" mean?, It means that the software is still under heavy development and big updates can be made that change, add, or remove features.

- RetroDECK is missing some minor and major; emulators, features and configurations. The goal is to have them added over time.<br>
 Please check the [[RetroDECK: Known Issues]] page and the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/issues) for more information. 

- RetroDECK during the BETA period supports the Steam Deck and the Linux Desktop. The full release should have better Linux Desktop support to make it as easy to handle as when you install it on a Steam Deck [FAQs: General questions](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/FAQs:-Frequently-asked-questions#general-questions). 
- The "b" in the versioning stands for BETA but RetroDECK is perfectly fine for daily use even during the beta phase, albeit some features are missing. To see what features are missing check the: [[RetroDECK: Known Issues]].

# Whats the long term vision and goals?
The long term vision and goals of the project is an all-in-one application to manage your entire retro games library that is: 

- Already configured and should just work with your games.

- Has disaster recovery and multi device support: with cloud saves and syncs.

- Easy to install with one click installation.

- Easy to use and provide a "Console-like / Batocera-like" featured user experience. 

- Easy to manage your collections of roms, mods and romhacks.

- As much as possible should be configurable from inside RetroDECK itself without needing to exiting the application. 

- Make tighter integrations with bundled emulators and expose more features and ways to handle them to the end users. 

- Should be secure, safe, and stable.

- Should have an easy way to mange external controllers and other inputs.

- Should support a majority of all supported Emulators in ES-DE, so at least you have one good option per system.

- Should in the long run support applications outside of the scope of ES-DE via a ports manager.

- Should be plug and play and fill the need for a portable retro gaming solution that you can bring on the go to a friend‚Äôs/family/others house. Just dock into the TV and get going!

- Should fully support Steam Deck, Linux Desktop, other SteamOS or Linux based devices.

- AND MORE
