## Discover Overlay
If you use Discord this is a program that adds Discord integration into the Steam Deck's gamemode UI.
It's already in on Flathub and downloadable in Discover. Note that you need to install and login to Discord as well.

## Decky Loader
Is a great piece of software that allows custom plugins inside Steam Deck's gamemode. It can open up more advanced features then the standard Steam Deck experience offers. But it's a bit more technical to install, please follow the guide on their github.

### Plugin: PowerTools
PowerTools let's you do advanced tweaking of the Steam Decks hardware. This can greatly improve performance on certain games in the PS2,GC and above generations. But it requires you to find the knowledge of what setting works best for each game and/or emulator.

### Plugin: AutoFlatpaks
AutoFlatpaks let's you update/install/manage flatpaks directly from gamemode. You can for example update RetroDECK directly from gamemode.
