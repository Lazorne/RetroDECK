# What is RetroDECK?

Instead of having several different software on your system for a variety of emulators and frontends you only need to have one: RetroDECK.

RetroDECK is a [EmulationStation Desktop Edition](https://es-de.org) (ES-DE) powered flatpak application that thanks to its framework it builds-in and manage a variety of emulators and other software that allows you to play your favorite retro (and even not-so-retro) games in one complete package.

## So what does that mean?
It means that RetroDECK provides all the emulators and frontend, configures them for you and put them into one application you can download from Flathub.

By being one application RetroDECK can put all important files in one location for all the emulators, instead of having them spread out over your entire system and even add features on top to orchestrate them seamlessly.

## What else?
As previously mentioned, RetroDECK also adds the `RetroDECK Framework` and the `RetroDECK Configurator` on top of the emulators and ES-DE interface that allows deeper integrations between emulators and easier exposure to a variety of features that you otherwise need to set per emulator basis to create a uniformity between them.

**What can the RetroDECK Framework do?**

It can help with:

- Compressing games
- File management
- Tools for troubleshooting (BIOS Checker, Multi-File Structure Checker, Partial or full reset of functions)
- Auto installing some free BIOSes
- Install prebuilt Steam Input profiles for devices like the Steam Deck and external controllers
- Easier management of `mods`, `roms`, `texture_packs`, `scraped media`, `screenshots`, `saves / states` `gamelists` and more
- Give access to global presets that can be acitivated to configure things over many emulators in one go like: `RetroAchievements`
  `Borders` `Widescreen Mode` `Swaping A/B X/Y for Nintendo Games`
