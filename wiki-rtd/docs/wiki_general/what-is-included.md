# RetroDECK: What's included?

## General information
We plan to add more emulators and functions over course of the development cycle. The goal is to support all of the systems ES-DE supports and ship the best emulator for that systems. We don't have any plans to ship all emulators in existence for each system but virtually only the best one per-system (this is more theoretical than practical) to avoid confusion and the user being loss in the choice.

## Systems

### Emulationstation Desktop Edition - RetroDECK Version
Emulationstation Desktop Edition (ES-DE) is the base frontend for RetroDECK. RetroDECK comes with specific tweaks to the ES-DE standard setup to enable RetroDECK unique functions like the `RetroDECK Framework` and `RetroDECK Configurator`. These tweaks are possible thanks to a collaborations with the ES-DE project and the RetroDECK project.

### The RetroDECK Configurator
Is a powerful Utility that can be use to change/modify and manipulate various aspects of RetroDECK.
