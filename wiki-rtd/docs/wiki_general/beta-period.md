# RetroDECK is currently in in BETA

What does `currently in beta` mean?

It means that the software is still under heavy development and big updates can be made that changes or adds certain features:

- RetroDECK is missing some minor and major; emulators, features and configurations. The goal is to have them added over time.

- A list of issues and missing featurescan be found over [[RetroDECK: Known Issues]] page and the [Issue tracker](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/issues).

- RetroDECK during the BETA period supports the Steam Deck and the Linux Desktop. The full release should have better Linux Desktop support to make it as easy as use as on the Steam Deck.

- RetroDECK is perfectly fine for daily use even during the beta phase and the core application should seen be stable. We still consider it beta since the want to add more features before a stable release. There are also experimental features that could be unstable but those are exclusive to the cooker builds or have to be enabled from commandline by testers.

- RetroDECK will still keep developing post the stable release.

# So what's the difference betwen this beta and the cooker version?
Since the beta is the actual mainline that is in fact the stable channel, the cooker version is the unstable, under development branch. More on that in the [FAQs](#what-is-retrodeck-cooker).
