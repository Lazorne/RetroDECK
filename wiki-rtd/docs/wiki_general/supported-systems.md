# What devices/systems does RetroDECK currently support?

## Steam Deck LCD/OLED
Supported from the start and RetroDECK is tailored to the Steam Deck.

## Linux Desktop
It is working, but the user experience might not be that great it as we want it to be just yet.
You will also need to manually configure the input to match your desktop and might need to tweak more settings. If you want to try it make sure that your distribution has flatpak support (else you will need to install it).

## Other SteamOS or Linux handheld gaming devices with flatpak support
We do plan to support other SteamOS based devices in the future. But during the BETA we are focusing on the Steam Deck.<br/>
You can get it to run on other Linux based devices it is not just as seamless as we want it to be and does not live up to our higher standards.<br/>
You will need to manually configure the input to match your device and might need to tweak more settings if you try it on a none Steam Deck device. There might also be some hardware specific bugs.

## Do you have any plans for other systems or snap versions?
Check the Supported Devices / OS section in the FAQ.
