# EmulationStation Desktop Edition: Themes

This section in the ES-DE User guide tells you how to use themes.<br>
[Theme settings](https://gitlab.com/es-de/emulationstation-de/-/blob/master/USERGUIDE.md#themes)

What follows is a short summery.

## How to switch between themes?
Go into `Main Menu` - `UI Settings` - `Theme Set` to select the theme you want to use.

## ES-DE Theme List
Look over at the [Theme List](https://gitlab.com/es-de/themes/themes-list) and find themes you like.

## How do I add additional themes?

RetroDECK uses [ES-DE](https://www.es-de.org) for its interface so any theme that is compatible with ES-DE can also be used with RetroDECK

### From the Theme Downloader

Go into `Main Menu` - `UI Settings` - `Theme Downloader` from there you can download a wide array of themes.

### From the Internet
If you find a theme you would like to use that is not in the `Theme Downloader` please download it and place it in `~/retrodeck/themes` (make sure the theme has its own folder in that directory).
