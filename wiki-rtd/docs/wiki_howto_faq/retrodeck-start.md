# Step 2: BIOS & Firmware

**NOTE:** On the Steam Deck this step needs to be done in Desktop Mode

## Information
Read up on [BIOS & Firmware](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/BIOS-and-Firmware)

* The BIOS & Firmware files go into the `~/retrodeck/bios/` directory <br>


**Example:**<br>
You have a BIOS for the PSX called `exampleBIOSPSX.bin`, you just put that file into the `~/retrodeck/bios/` folder.

# Step 3: ROMs

**NOTE:** On the Steam Deck this step needs to be done in Desktop Mode

## On ROMs

Rom files needs to be put in their corresponding system directory inside the `roms` folder.<br>
Note that the `roms` folder location can be different depending on where you choose to put it during the installation process. The following options are available during the installation:

### **Choice: Internal**<br>
If during the installation of RetroDECK you choose the Internal option for the roms folder:<br>
The roms folder is:`~/retrodeck/roms/`

### **Choice: SDCard**<br>
If during the installation of RetroDECK you choose the SDCard option for the roms folder:<br>
The roms folder is: `<sdcard>/retrodeck/roms/`<br>

(Please note that the `<sdcard>` is an example and not called so inside your Linux/SteamOS system but rather your unique per SDCard ID number).<br>

### **Choice: Custom**<br>
If during the installation of RetroDECK you choose the Custom option for the roms folder:<br>
The roms folder where ever you choose.


## Let's get started on ROMs:

Read up on [Emulators: Folders & File extensions](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/Emulators:-Folders-&-File-extensions) to see what folder each system has.
* Put the corresponding roms inside the corresponding system folder

**Example:**<br>
You have an example NES game called `ExampleNESGame.nes` <br>
You have to put that game into the `/retrodeck/roms/nes` folder.

# Step 4: Playing the ROMs

## Steam Deck - Gamemode
Return to gamemode on the Steam Deck and start up RetroDECK. Now the systems you put rom files for should be shown and be able to be played.

**Example:**<br>
The NES column should now be shown with our `ExampleNESGame.nes` from `Step 3`

## Linux Desktop
Start up RetroDECK from Steam. Now the systems you put rom files for should be shown and be able to be played.

**Example:**<br>
The NES column should now be shown with our `ExampleNESGame.nes` from `Step 3`
