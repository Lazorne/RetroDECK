# Flight Controllers

Flight Controllers is a broad category that encompasses the vast majority of third party controllers that are used for playing games where you are flying airplanes or other things as magic carpets. <br>

As long as you can connect the flight solution to USB and it works with xinput it should work with RetroDECK.
