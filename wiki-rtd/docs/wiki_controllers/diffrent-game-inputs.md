# Different button prompts in games

Depending on what system you are playing the button prompt inputs might not correspond to the one you have on your physical controller.

## Xbox Games
The Xbox layout is used by Xbox controllers and is also used by devices like the `Steam Deck` `Rog Alley` and other `Genric` third party PC controllers.

**Xbox - Button Layout:**<br>

| Button Placement  | Button |
| :---              | :---:  |
| Top               |  `Y`   |
| Left              |  `X`   |
| Right             |  `B`   |
| Bottom            |  `A`   |


**Example:**<br>
So if you are emulating a Xbox game that calls for the button `B` to be pressed it corresponds to the right button.

## Nintendo Games
The Nintendo layout is used by Nintendo controllers and could also be used by other `Genric` third party Nintendo Clone controllers.

**Nintendo - Button Layout**<br>

| Button Placement  | Button |
| :---              | :---:  |
| Top               |  `X`   |
| Left              |  `Y`   |
| Right             |  `A`   |
| Bottom            |  `B`   |


**Example:**<br>
So if you are emulating a Nintendo game that calls for the button `A` to be pressed it corresponds to the right button.

## Sony PlayStation Games
The Playstation layout is used by Playstation controllers and could also be used by other `Genric` third party Playstation Clone controllers.

**Playstation - Button Layout**<br>

| Button Placement  | Button      |
| :---              | :---:       |
| Top               |  `Triangle` |
| Left              |  `Square`   |
| Right             |  `Circle`   |
| Bottom            |  `X`        |

**Example:**

If you are emulating a PlayStation game that calls for the button `Square` to be pressed it corresponds to the left button.

**Regional differences:**

Depending on the region of your Playstation game, the buttons `Circle` and `X` switches the meaning for confirm and cancel (they are still at the same physical location). But it is good to keep in mind if you are used to exiting out of menus with a certain button and wondering why it works in some games while others not. In games from the EU/US `X` is confirm while in Japan `X` is cancel.
