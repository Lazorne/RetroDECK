### Release Date: 2023-08-22

## Information:
- Steam Deck users update RetroDECK from `Discover` in Desktop Mode.
- Don't forget to reapply the latest controller layout: Go into the `Templates` tab and reapply the new profile ending with 0.7.1b (there is no need to reinstall the entire layout from the Configurator).
  

## Bugfixes & other changes: 
- Fixed an issue to make sure the RD controller layout file at update with each RD update.
- Fixed an issue with PPSSPP that made `L` and `R` incorrectly bound.
- Fixed an issue in the Configurator that prevented the Yuzu preset for swapping A/B X/Y from working.

## Updates
- All Emulators and ES-DE have been updated

## Steam Deck - Global Controller Layout:
We have done some  changes based on community feedback

**Layout Changes:**
- `Select` is now a hotkey trigger while pressing it down, `L4` and `R4` are still triggers as well. 
- The RetroArch combo of `Select`  + `Start` = `Quit` now works on many SA-Emulators.
- `Open Menu` is removed from `Select`.
- `R5`  = `A` button (this allows for great Wii controls on the right touchpad and pressing down the R5 for A).
- `L5` = `B` button.

**Global hotkey changes:**
- `Open Menu` is on `Y`.
- `Increase Emulation Speed`  is on `Dpad-UP`.
- `Decrease Emulation Speed` is on `Dpad-Down`.
- `Fullscreen OFF` command is removed (as emulators have migrated to toggle).

## Known issues
- The built in auto-updater is not working (we are working on it). Discover is ok.
- Some emulators don't have hotkey support or have bugs affecting their hotkeys.


# RetroDECK v0.7.0b - Amazing Aozora 

### Release Date: 2023-06-16

## Read First – Important Changes!  

* `PCSX2-SA` latest updates are not compatible with old save states. Please make sure you do an in-game save to your virtual memory card before upgrading.  

* The following emulators have changed the defaults and now run the stand-alone version: `Dolphin`, `Citra`, `PPSSPP`. <br>
If you have saves states or just want to go back to the RetroArch version, you can always switch back by pressing: `Other Settings` – `Alternative Emulators` and set them back to the core versions.  

* If you decide to install the new `RetroDECK Controller Layout` for the Steam Deck (highly recommended), it will wipe your custom configurations and emulator settings. That’s because all the configs needs to be updated and changed to be compatible. <br>
The choice is yours (you can always install it later via the Configurator if you change your mind). 


## New Emulators 

- Wii U powered by CEMU 

- We had hopes to add MAME standalone as well but we had to push it towards a future update because of various issues. That's why there is a MAME submenu in the new radial menus.

 

## New General Features  

### New - Steam Deck Controller Layout 

Please read up on: https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/Steam-Deck%3A-Hotkeys-and-controls 
- All hotkeys for all emulators have been unified where possible. 

This Steam Deck Controller Layout features both 

- Radial input menus on the left touchpad. 
- Button bound hotkeys you can access by either holding R4 or L4.  

**Installation of the layout:**

**From an upgrade:**

A upgrade from a older version to 0.7b you will get a prompt during the upgrade process that asks you if you want to install the layout. If you choose to do this (highly recommended), it will reset your emulators custom configurations if you had them. 

**For everyone (upgrade or fresh install):**

After installation need to manually enable the config as under (you also need to do this for a new RetroDECK install): <br>
`Controller Settings` -> `Controller Layouts` -> `Templates` `RetroDECK: Official Layout` with a version number. 

**NOTE:**

Not all Emulators has hotkey support; some have partial support, some has none and some has a majority implemented.

**Known issues:**

PPSSPP has an issue with flatpak hotkeys currently on their github so we have mapped ESC `HK + R3` ( press the `Escape` key from the radial menu) to `Open PPSSPP Menu`. In this way you can shutdown, save and access PPSSPP functions from there. 
As soon as the issue is solved we will remap everything to the correct hotkeys.

### New -  RetroDECK system folders 

Handling modpacks and texture packs has never been easier! You can read more on the wiki! 

https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki 

**New folder: Mods**

`retrodeck/mods/` Inside you will find easy to access mod folders for the following systems: Citra ,Dolphin, Primehack, Yuzu 
     

**New folder: Texture Packs** 

`retrodeck/texture_packs/` inside you will find easy to access texture pack folders for the following systems: Citra, Dolphin, Duckstation, PCSX2, PPSSPP, Primehack, RetroArch-Mesen, RetroArch-Mupen64Plus

### Release Date: 2022-10-12

## Important: New save folder structure and migration in 0.5.0b

### General information


[I see ~ refereed in documentation and examples, what does it mean?](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/FAQs-Frequently-asked-questions#i-see--refereed-in-documentation-and-examples-what-does-it-mean)

**Saves = game saves and save states**<br>
The word "saves" is used to reference both save files and save state files in this wiki article. Both files are treated in the same manner, the only difference is that saves are located at. 

**PLEASE BE PATIENT:** <br>
The migration of the saves only needs to be done once. <br>
Depending on how large roms library you have, this migration can take several minutes.<br>
If you have an extremely large roms library (+5.000 roms) this process can take over an hour. 

### Why are you changing the save folder structure?

In the long run, it is about the safety of your saves and we feel it's better to tackle this now during the beta period then later. 

By default, RetroArch (which handles emulation of most older systems) puts all your saves together in one folder. <br>
This is normally not an issue, but what you if you want to play the same game but different versions of it across multiple systems? <br>
RetroArch has no way of telling the difference between a save for `Mortal Kombat 3` on the Sega Genesis and on the Super Nintendo when the saves are all bundled together. RetroDECK is moving to a save storage structure where every save file is in a per system sub-folder inside of the `~/retrodeck/saves/` for game saves or `~/retrodeck/states/` for save states.

### How saves are stored in RetroDECK pre 0.5.0b:

_Example: Structure of the `~/retrodeck/saves/` folder_
    
    ~/retrodeck/saves/Final Fantasy 3.save

    ~/retrodeck/saves/Sonic the Hedgehog.save

_Example: Structure of the `~/retrodeck/states/` folder_
    
    ~/retrodeck/saves/Final Fantasy VI.savestate

    ~/retrodeck/saves/Sonic the Hedgehog 2.savestate


### How saves are stored in RetroDECK post 0.5.0b:

_Example: Structure of the `~/retrodeck/saves/` folder and with new sub-folders_

    ~/retrodeck/saves/nes/Super Mario Bros. 3.save

    ~/retrodeck/saves/genesis/Sonic the Hedgehog.save

_Example: Structure of the `~/retrodeck/states/` folder_
    
    ~/retrodeck/states/snes/Final Fantasy VI.savestate

    ~/retrodeck/states/genesis/Sonic the Hedgehog 2.savestate

Since RetroArch will be looking for your saves in new locations, RetroDECK will do its best to sort your saves into the new structure automatically, so you likely won't need to do anything except enjoy knowing your saves are safer than ever.

### How will it work?

* The fist time you run RetroDECK after upgrading from a previews version to 0.5.0b a new dialog prompt will appear letting you that the migration process will start after pressing `OK`.

* The migration process matches up all of your saves with all of your ROMs. 

* Once a match is found, the save is moved to where the sub-folder it needs to be in. 

* At the end of the process RetroDECK will let you know if any saves could not be sorted automatically.

* **NOTE:** Only saves created by RetroArch need to be sorted, standalone emulators such as Yuzu and Citra already use their own folder structure and don't need to go through this process.

* **NOTE:** If a match can't be found (for instance if you have a save for Mortal Kombat 3 and have both the SNES and Genesis editions in your ROM library) the save will be left alone and will need to be sorted manually, since only you will know for sure what system you were playing that game on. 

### Where will my saves be moved to? 

The saves will still be in the `~/retrodeck/saves` folder, but will also be moved into a new folder that matches what system the associated game is on.

 _Example: Game save - The Legend of Zelda on the NES_<br>

`~/retrodeck/saves/The Legend of Zelda.save`

 will be moved to

 `~/retrodeck/saves/nes/The Legend of Zelda.save`

 _Example 2: Save state - Super Mario Bros 3 on the NES_<br>

`~/retrodeck/states/Super Mario Bros 3.savestate`

 will be moved to

 `~/retrodeck/states/nes/Super Mario Bros 3.savestate`

### Why could not all saves be moved automatically? 

If you have a large ROM library, it is likely you will have multiple versions of the same game across multiple systems.

RetroArch creates save files that have the same name as the original ROM file. If there are multiple ROM files with the same name as a save, there is no way to tell which system the save belongs to.

In the interest of ultimate safety for your saves, we only sort files we can be sure of. It is unfortunate that some saves may need to be sorted manually for some users, but this is a one time process that will keep your saves safer in the long run.

### How do I move them manually? 

The saves can be moved like any other file, using the Dolphin file manager included in the Steam Deck desktop mode to the corresponding sub-folder inside `/retrodeck/saves/(system sub-folder)`. 

### Where can I find saves that could not be moved?

If you see a message after the migration process saying some of your saves could not be sorted automatically, they will be found where they have always been, in `~/retrodeck/saves` or `~/retrodeck/states`. 

In the `~/retrodeck` folder there will also be a file called `manual_sort_needed.log` listing every save that could not be sorted automatically with a reason it was not moved. In order to be used again, these files will need to be moved into the folder matching the name of the system that the game the save belongs to runs on.

For example, this save file could not be sorted automatically, because there are multiple ROMs in the library with the same name.

**Example: Game saves** <br
A game save from Mortal Kombat 3: `saves/Mortal Kombat 3.save`

Two roms with the same name exist, one for the SNES and one for the Genesis/Megadrive:

    ~/retrodeck/roms/genesis/Mortal Kombat 3.rom

    ~/retrodeck/roms/snes/Mortal Kombat 3.rom

If you have playing on the SNES, the save will need to be moved to:

`/retrodeck/saves/snes/Mortal Kombat 3.save`

If you have been playing on the Genesis/Megadrive, the save will need to be moved to:

`/retrodeck/saves/genesis/Mortal Kombat 3.save`

**Example 2: Save states** <br
A save state from Street Fighter 2: `states/Street Fighter 2.savestate`

Two roms with the same name exist, one for the SNES and one for the Genesis/Megadrive:

    ~/retrodeck/roms/genesis/Street Fighter 2.rom

    ~/retrodeck/roms/snes/Street Fighter 2.rom

If you have playing on the SNES, the save will need to be moved to:

`/retrodeck/states/snes/Street Fighter 2.savestate`

If you have been playing on the Genesis/Megadrive, the save will need to be moved to:

`/retrodeck/states/genesis/Street Fighter 2.savestate`
