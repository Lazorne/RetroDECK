# General information 

[I see SA refereed in documentation about emulators what does it mean?](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/FAQs%3A-Frequently-asked-questions#i-see-sa-refereed-in-documentation-about-emulators-what-does-it-mean)
## Different controller layouts in games

### Xbox layout - Steam Deck 
The Steam Deck uses the Xbox button layout as it's physical buttons.

**Steam Deck/Xbox button layout:**<br>

| Button Placement  | Button |
| :---              | :---:  |
| Top               |  `Y`   |
| Left              |  `X`   |
| Right             |  `B`   |
| Bottom            |  `A`   |

### Nintendo Layout
Nintendo systems uses the Nintendo layout in game where both the Y-X and A-B buttons have switched places with each other from the Steam Decks physical button layout. You can enable a mode that switches the Y-X and A-B buttons for supported Emulators inside the `RetroDECK Configurator`. 

<br>

**Nintendo - button layout:**<br>
| Button Placement  | Button |
| :---              | :---:  |
| Top               |  `X`   |
| Left              |  `Y`   |
| Right             |  `A`   |
| Bottom            |  `B`   |


**Example:**<br>
So if you are emulating a Nintendo game that calls for the button A to be pressed it corresponds to the right button on the Steam Deck so button B.


### Sony PlayStation Layout
The Sony PlayStation uses it's icon glyphs to represent it's buttons.

**Sony PlayStation - button layout:**<br>
| Button Placement  | Button      |
| :---              | :---:       |
| Top               |  `Triangle` |
| Left              |  `Square`   |
| Right             |  `Circle`   |
| Bottom            |  `X`    |

**Example:**<br>
So if you are emulating a PlayStation game that calls for the button Triangle to be pressed it corresponds to the top button on the Steam Deck so button Y.

**Regional differences:**

Depending on the region of your Playstation game, the buttons `Circle` and `X` switches the meaning for confirm and cancel (they are still at the same physical location). But it is good to keep in mind if you are used to exiting out of menus with a certain button and wondering why it works in some games while others not.

**Example:**

In the EU/US `X` is confirm while in Japan `X` is cancel.

# RetroDECK Official Controller Layout: Hotkeys:

### Current version of the layout
0.7.1b that is written on this wiki

## Information
Be sure to have the `RetroDECK: Official Controller Layout` activated from the `Templates`. 
- Add the Official Layout under `Controller Settings` -> `Controller Layouts` -> `Templates` in the Steam Deck called `RetroDECK: Official Layout` with a version number and apply 

Read more on  <br>[[Steam Deck: Installation and updates]]

## Everything is customizable
You are free to rebind the keys as you see fit in the RetroDECK: Official Layout profile and make your own to better suit your needs. <br>
But if you rebind the keys inside RetroDECK there can be a risk that an upcoming update will revert your changes if the emulators made changes to the keybindings for the hotkeys. <br>
Also note that if you break your controller profile with your tinkering please revert the RetroDECK's official profile. 

## ðŸš§ Please READ: ðŸš§

**Not all Emulators has hotkey support; some have partial support, some has none and some has a majority implemented**

The plan is to map as much as we can into the RetroDECK Hotkey System below. We are also patching in Emulator Hotkeys with the `RetroDECK Framework` (if possible) to be compatible with the system. If a emulators later versions adds better hotkey support we plan to map it towards the same functions bellow for a unified experience across as many emulators as possible.  

### Known issues
* `PPSSPP` has a bug in with multi-input hotkeys in their flatpak version, so we did a workaround and bound ESC is Open Menu. This allows you to access all of the emulator features and can quit.
* `RPCS3` hotkeys/shortcuts do not work and they are a new experimental feature. To exit you have to shut down RPCS3 from the `Switch Window` inside the Steam Deck interface. 
* `CEMU` has almost no hotkey support.
* `XEMU` has no hotkey support.
*  `Citra` is the only dual-screen emulator that allows a hotkey for changing the screen layout, others: `MelonDS`, `RetroArch`, `Cemu` has no hotkey for it.

## Global Hotkeys: Button Combos

### The hotkey button 
The `HK` or `hotkey button` on the Steam Deck is `L4` or `R4` or `Select` depending on what is closest for the button combo you are trying to press, all trigger the same functions.

**Example:**

You want to do the command `Pause / Resume`. <br>
You press and hold either `L4` or `R4` or `Select` and press `A` to trigger the command.

### Button combo list
The global hotkeys are activated by pressing the hotkey button and holding it while pressing the corresponding other button input.
What follows is a list of hotkeys: 

`Command` Shows what the hotkey does. <br>
`Button / Combination` Shows the input you need to make to trigger the command. <br>
`Keyboard Command` Shows what is being sent to the emulator. <br>
`Emulator Support` Shows what emulators support the command. <br>
`Comment` Just extra comments. <br>

Yes, just press  on the `HK` trigger buttons: `L4` or `R4` or `Select` 

## Radial Menu System
`Radial Button` Shows what the hotkey does. <br>
`Keyboard Command` Shows what is being sent to the emulator.<br> 
`Emulator Support` Shows what emulators support the command. <br>

## Quick
The `Quick Menu` or `Quick Access Menu` Menu is the most populated menu. It features "best of" options from other menus.
